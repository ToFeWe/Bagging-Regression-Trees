.. _paper:

***********************************
Research paper and the presentation
***********************************

The following final outputs have been created in the project:
    * :file:`bagging_paper.tex` contains the term paper.
    * :file:`bagging_pres.tex` contains the presentation as held for the project module.
    * :file:`external_figures` contains files that are not created by the build process.


IMPORTANT: Due to the rework of the project in the replication environment waf, the numerical output between the paper created here and the paper handed it differs slightly.
This is however only a numerical difference and does **not** alter any fundamental results. Basically the difference boils down to a different choice of random seed and how it is passed in the code.
