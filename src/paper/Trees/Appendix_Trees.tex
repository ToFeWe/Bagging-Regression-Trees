\subsection{Instability of Regression Trees}

\noindent
Figure \ref{fig:Tree_Instability} undermines the intuition behind the instability of Regression Trees with a graphical illustration. The Regression Tree in Figure \ref{fig:Tree_Instability} (a) is constructed on the basis of an initial data set. Now consider a perturbation of the data set, which leads to a different choice of splitting variable in the second layer (right node). This change affects all nodes following the altered decision rule as well (see Figure \ref{fig:Tree_Instability} (b)). Changes are indicated by red.
